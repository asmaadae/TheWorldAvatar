# Mapbox Example Visualisation

This example visualisation has been put together to demonstrate the intended use of the TWA Visualisation Framework (TWA-VF). This framework has been designed to make it easier for users not experienced with Typescript (or the mapping libraries) to quickly & easily put together a new Digital Twin visualisation. It is intended for developers to use this example visualisation to gain an understanding of the TWA-VF before attempting to create their own visualisation; to do that, this example can be copied and used as a starting point.

It is recommended that you read the through the [TWA-VF Overview](../docs/overview.md) and [Working with Mapbox](../docs/mapbox.md) sections of the documentation before playing around with this example.

## Sample Data

A small amount of sample data has been committed to demonstrate the power of the TWA-VF to visualise different data types. Please do not make changes to the sample data without consulting the original developer. At the time of writing, the sample data sets include:

- **Cambridge**:
  - Based in and around Cambridge, this data set mimics a single stack that contains data on college locations and buildings.
  - The colleges layer demonstrates how clustering can be achieved.
  - No metadata or timeseries present in this data set.
- **Singapore**:
  - Based in Singapore, this data set includes details of rail lines and stations.
  - Shows examples of setting up data-driven styling within the `data.json` file.
  - No metadata or timeseries present in this data set.
- **India**:
  - Based in India, this data set shows rasterised locations of Aqueducts and Canals.
  - This data is pulled from a public WMS endpoint provided by Stanford University.
  - No metadata or timeseries present in this data set.

In most deployed visualisations, an online stack of microservices will provide data endpoints through which data can be queried/loaded onto the visualisation. In this example, no online stack is used, solely to remove a lengthy prerequisite step. Instead, sample data in local GeoJSON files have been added (to be hosted by the visualisation's web server) and, in one case, a community provided WMS endpoint connected to.

In production, it is advised that all data is loaded into a geospatial data provider (like GeoServer) and a WMS endpoint used; local files can be utilised but then do not offer the optimisation and caching of services like GeoServer. For more information on how to do this, see the README for the [Stack Data Uploader](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-data-uploader).

It's also worth noting that with this example visualisation, no stack or FeatureInfoAgent is running, hence there is no support for dynamic metadata and timeseries data is unavailable. This is something that we plan to work on in future.

## Building the Image

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the required configuration to build a Docker Image for the example visualisation. This uses the `twa-vf` image as a base then adds the contents of the `webspace` directory to a volume mounted at `/var/www/html` within the container.

- Files to be hosted must be contained within the `webspace` directory.
- A valid Mapbox username and API token must be provided.
- A connection to the internet is required to contact remote resources and use the mapping libraries.

Once the requirements have been addressed, the image can be built using the below commands, run from within this directory.

- To build the Image:
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build --force-rm`
- To generate a Container (i.e. run the Image):
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate`
