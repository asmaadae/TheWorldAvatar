# Default Visualisation Configurations

After uploading the Bavaria CityGML data to the stack, three sets of b3dm files are generated by py3dtiler:

- LOD2 Buildings: Buildings with LoD2 are visualised.
- LOD2 Features: Roof, ground and wall surfaces of LoD2 buildings are visualised.
- LOD1-LOD2 Buildings: Buildings are shown as LoD1 when zoomed out and as LoD2 when zoomed in.

They can be visualised by the [Digital Twin Visualisation Framework (DTVF) with Cesium](../../../../../../../web/digital-twin-vis-framework/example-cesium-vis).

Example data.json and settings.json are provided in this folder (User will need to register with [MapTiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/) to get an API key for settings.json; otherwise no terrain elevation in the visualisation, buildings would appear to be floating). Please read the README.md of the DTVF for instructions of spinning up the visualisation.
