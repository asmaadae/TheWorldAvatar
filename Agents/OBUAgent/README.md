# Covalent Organic Framework Precursor Space Exploration Algorithms

## Repository Overview

This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of algorithms specifically designed for exploring precursor spaces in the context of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These algorithms aim to efficiently analyze and process the relationships between COF precursors and their associated properties, facilitating deeper insights and understanding of the underlying structures and patterns in the development of advanced COF materials.

## Usage and Applications

The algorithms in this repository can be used for a wide range of applications related to covalent organic frameworks, including but not limited to:

- Discovering novel precursors for the synthesis of COFs with desired properties
- Analyzing the relationships between COF precursors and their associated properties, namely binding sites, core units, and outer coordination number of the binding sites.

By employing these algorithms, researchers and practitioners working on covalent organic frameworks can gain a better understanding of the complex relationships within COF precursor spaces and make more informed decisions in the design and development of advanced materials.
