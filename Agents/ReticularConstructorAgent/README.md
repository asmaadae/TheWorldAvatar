# ReticularConstructorAgent

## Dependencies
Python 3.7 or later
A working installation of the Atomic Simulation Environment.

## Repository Overview

The ReticularConstructorAgent is a semantic agent that wraps the AuToGraFS software. It provides a seamless interface between the robust capabilities of AuToGraFS and the unique function of constructing reticular topologies. By sourcing information either from a knowledge graph or directly from user input, this agent specializes in the creation of reticular structures, with a particular emphasis on covalent organic frameworks (COFs).

## Usage and Applications

AuToGraFS Integration: Seamless integration with the Automatic Topological Generator for Framework Structures software.

Reticular Topologies Creation: Efficient generation of topologies by taking advantage of the tools and libraries from AuToGraFS.
